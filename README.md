Preppin' Data challenges are designed to help people develop their data cleaning skills. While challenges are usually intended to be completed through Tableau Prep Builder, it is possible to use other tools such as SQL and Python. 

I am connecting to these challenges using my current employer's Snowflake environment. If you'd like to follow along, you'll need to download the challenges and work on them using TPB/Python/R/etc. or publish the challenges into a SQL server.
